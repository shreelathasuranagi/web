        <p>I met <strong>Tan</strong> right infront of our department, on the first day of college. I was confused as to whom I must talk to and apparently I'm not
            very good at people skills because I'm an introvert. She came up to me and said... "Hi.." and that's how it started. We shared everything 
            about ourselves in just a day, and I have never become so close to anyone in such a short span of time. The comfort zone I had with her since the first day made 
            it so easy for me to open up and be myself. These past 3 years with her was like a dream, and my favourite kind of <strong>novel. </strong>
            It was not just about laughter, it was the way she sat by me and let me cry, heard my stories thousand times before I actually <strong>healed</strong>
            and the way she cares and understands me better than anyone. With her, I can be my perfectly imperfect self, and I just want her to know that
            I will always be that person who will protect her, tell people <strong>NO</strong> on behalf of her (because apparently she's bad at that lol),
            and care for her. Thank you for listening to my never ending talks about anime, and my <strong> descriptive novel stories</strong>... Thank you for always being there
            even when it was hard... and thank you for never giving up. Just because I said all this doesn't mean <strong> I love you</strong> or something ewww.
            You know it all...!
